# Tic-tac-toe game

A simple tic-tac-toe game in React + Typescript

Note: to speed up development I have used CSS nesting, which is only supported in the most recent versions of major browsers (see https://caniuse.com/css-nesting). To ensure that the app displays properly please use Chrome 120+/Firefox 117+/Safari 17.2+.

## Features

- Choose dificulty when playing against computer
- Choose time per move - if the time expires before making a move, you lose your turn
- Responsive design
